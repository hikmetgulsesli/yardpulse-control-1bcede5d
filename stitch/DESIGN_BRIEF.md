# STITCH_BATCH_BRIEF

Generate exactly 6 production-quality UI screens for the Product Surface targets below.
Batch stage: all surfaces.
Generate every SCREEN_SPEC in this batch call. Do not generate screens outside this stage.
If this Stitch project already has screens from an earlier stage, preserve the same visual system, navigation pattern, density, typography, spacing, and component language.
Target device type: DESKTOP.
All visible user-facing text must be in English.

## PRODUCT_VISION_SUMMARY
- YardPulse Control turns the user's request into a directly usable web workflow. The first experience must be the actual web product behavior, not a marketing landing page or placeholder demo.
- - FR-001: Build a compact browser rail yard dispatch board app called YardPulse Control. It should manage train arrivals, track assignments, delay exceptions, crew handoffs, reports, settings, empty/error states, search/filter/sort controls, and persistent local state. Use a Vite React web app. Every generated screen…
- Users who need the requested web product to work immediately with clear feedback, recovery paths, and deterministic verification hooks.

- data_entities: Item, ActivityEvent, Preference
- visible_actions: ACT_RETRY_LOAD as primary_button, ACT_CREATE_RECORD as secondary_button
- entry_exit_rules: SURF_ITEM_OPERATIONS, SURF_INSIGHTS -> Recovery returns to the active Item workflow and preserves unrelated state.
- design_guidance: Recovery states must be useful product states, not blank placeholder panels.

## OUTPUT_RULES
- Create one distinct canvas/frame per SCREEN_SPEC.
- Do not create a design-system/style-guide canvas as an output screen. Apply the design system inside the product screens only.
- Do not output palette, typography, component inventory, or moodboard screens.
- Use exact_screen_title as the screen title/name. Do not rename screens to generic labels.
- Use unique_canvas_caption for that screen only. Do not reuse one global caption across screens.
- Do not place the whole chunk summary, PRD summary, Key Deliverables text, or any follow-up question as visible screen captions.
- Do not write 'How would you like to proceed?', 'We could refine...', or similar assistant chat text in the design output.
- Each screen must visibly emphasize its own required_content and visible_actions. Do not let all screens share the same layout content.

## STRICT_UI_SCOPE_CONTRACT
- Every generated screen must map to one or more SCREEN_SPECS above.
- Do not invent modules, dashboards, marketing pages, admin areas, ecommerce flows, docs, account, or profile areas outside the Product Surfaces.
- Every permitted action from the matching Product Surface should have a plausible visible control or platform-appropriate interaction.
- Empty, loading, validation, and error states may be included only inside the declared Product Surfaces.

## UI_SAFE_PRD_CONTEXT
Use this only to understand product behavior and missing UI states. Do not render this text directly. SCREEN_SPECS remain the active screen source.
## 1. Context And Goals - Overview: YardPulse Control turns the user's request into a directly usable web workflow. The first experience must be the actual web product behavior, not a marketing landing page or placeholder demo. - Target Audience: Users who need the requested web product to work immediately with clear feedback, recovery paths, and deterministic verification hooks. - UI Language: English. Pipeline metadata, action IDs, surface IDs, story titles, technical reports, and file identifiers remain English. - Core Objectives: - FR-001: Build a compact browser rail yard dispatch board app called YardPulse Control. It should manage train arrivals, track assignments, delay exceptions, crew handoffs, reports, settings, empty/error states, search/filter/sort controls, and persistent local state. Use a Vite React web app. Every generated screen reachable from the app shell must remain reachable after implementation; sidebar/nav items such as dashboard, dispatch, reports, inventory/yard assets, settings, help, and logout must render distinct functional views instead of collapsing to one fallback. Buttons and controls should perform real in-app state changes where applicable. - Business Goals: reduce ambiguity for downstream agents, preserve the requested domain, and keep unrelated modules out of scope. - User Goals: inspect current state, take primary actions, understand validation/recovery feedback, and return to a stable state after failures. - Primary Workflows: load product state, perform the main action, recover from validation/system errors, and verify final state through the platform-appropriate test surface. - Non-Functional: first usable state under 2s for local/frontend apps, WCAG 2.1 AA for UI platforms, deterministic test handles, and responsive behavior for UI platforms. - External Dependencies: none unless explicitly listed in the task or System Contracts. ## 3. Behavioral And Action Contract ## 5. Validation And Error Strategy - Validation Rules: required text fields cannot be empty; status/enum values must be known; dates/timestamps must be parseable; destructive actions require explicit user intent. - Business Logic Errors: show contextual messages near the action and keep the previous valid state. - System/Network Errors: show a retryable banner or inline state with lastError details suitable for QA, not a silent reset. - Error Display Policy: forms use inline errors; global load/persist failures use compact banners or state panels; no blocking alert dialogs unless the platform requires them. ## 9. Out Of Scope - No physical screen table, screen-count field, or agent-invented screen list in PLAN. - DESIGN receives only scoped UI-facing context derived from Product Surfaces, display fields, permitted actions, validation behavior, and UI anti-goals. - No modules outside Product Surfaces, Action Contracts, or explicit task requirements. - No local fallback design; DESIGN must use Stitch when DESIGN_REQUIRED=true and must block on Stitch failure.
